# Machine-Learning-Databases-Project
This project uses multiple python libraries such as pandas, numpy, pylab, etc...
to correctly make predictions based on categories and parameters set by me. After making predictive guesses, mulitple graphs are created to represent the population depending on different categores. For example female vs male predictions. These graphs describe not only the current data in the dataset, but also predictions being made, and how accurate these predictions are.


# The Project
Throughout this python notebook various parts of the code is seperated into 4 categories designed to make the understanding of the code easier and expansion of this notebook easier.   
### Loading the Dataset  
Load the dataset into this notebook. Data set used : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance

### Cleaning the Data  
Make the dataset easier to read from a computer sense. Make statements like true/false into 1/0. Make categories into associated numbers.

### Data Exploration  
Start finding ratios and distinctions between associated groups. For example difference between rural and urban, or male and female.

### Data Independence
Introduce the Logistic Regression model from the sklearn. From here create the margins and find the percentage comparisons.

### Data Seperation  
Take the data percentage comparisons and put them into graphs to better visualize data. In this case, display the ROC curves.
