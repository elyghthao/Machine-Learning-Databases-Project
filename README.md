# Machine-Learning-Databases-Project
This project uses multiple python libraries such as pandas, numpy, pylab, etc...
to correctly make predictions based on categories and parameters set by me. After making predictive guesses, mulitple graphs are created to represent the population depending on different categores. For example female vs male predictions. These graphs describe not only the current data in the dataset, but also predictions being made, and how accurate these predictions are.
